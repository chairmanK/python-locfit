INSTALLATION as an Splus 3.3 or 3.4 Library:

1) Determine your SHOME directory (type  Splus SHOME  to be sure).
1) Unpack the shar archive in a new locfit directory (you've
   already done that!).
   Site administrators, use $SHOME/library/locfit.
2) If your SHOME is **not** /usr/splus, you need to change
   SHOME  at the top of Makefile.S3.
3) Install with the unix command
   sh install.S3
4) (for Site Administrators) Add the line
   locfit        Local Regression, Likelihood and Density Estimation
   to the file $SHOME/library/README.
5) (Optional; check locfit is working first!) Remove the source files.
   On your locfit installation directory, remove everything **except**
   the locfit.so file and the .Data subdirectory and contents.

That's it! To access the locfit:
1) If you run S-Plus from your locfit installation directory,
   use the command
   > dyn.load.shared("./locfit.so")
2) If you run S-Plus from another directory, use
   > library("locfit",first=T,lib.loc=getenv("HOME"))
   Note the lib.loc argument should be the parent
   of your locfit directory; this can be omitted
   if you followed the Site Administrator installation.


INSTALLATION as an Splus 5 Library:

  I've been able to install as a library for S-Plus 5.0 and 5.1 under
  Irix, Linux and SunOS. The procedure should simply follow S-4, but
  the S-Plus people seem to have made unnecessary changes, introduced
  bugs e.t.c. to the library installation routines (whatever happened
  to "if it ain't broke, don't fix it"?).

  Please email me (catherine@research.bell-labs.com) with any problems.

  1) Ensure the SHOME environment variable is properly set.
  2) Run the <tt>install.S5</tt> script:
     % ./install.S5

  LOCFIT should now be ready to use. From another directory, the library
  is attached to Splus with
  > library("locfit",first=T)
  with a lib.loc argument if necessary.

  If you downloaded a binary version, Locfit should be ready to run
  as is. If you have permission, place the locfit directory in
  $SHOME/library/locfit.
  For IRIX users, the compilation won't work, unless you have more luck
  than me. Download the binary S.so.irix file from my web pages, and
  save as S.so. This was compiled in S-4, and seems to work with S-Plus 5.

INSTALLATION, C-Locfit stand alone version:

At the unix prompt, type
% make locfit
% mkdir LFData
% locfit
locfit> run install.cmd
locfit>    you're ready to go!

If your X files are *not* in /usr/X11R6/lib, you'll need to change the
XLDFLAGS line in the Makefile.

Locfit can also be compiled with ASCII graphics instead of X:
% make locfit-nox
