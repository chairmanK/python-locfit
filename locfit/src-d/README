This dircetory contains the main program, i/o functions and graphics
functions for the ASCII window and the x windows interface.

If readline is present on your system (does the /usr/include/readline
directory exist?), this can be enabled by adding #define READLINE
at the top of main.c, and in the top level Makefile, change the
LDFLAGS line to
LDFLAGS -lm -lreadline
This allows command line editing and history.
